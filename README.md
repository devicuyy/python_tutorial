**EDUCATION**

I went to Taiwan in 2018 to persue my bechelor degree in Business Administration in Finance and in the last year of my bechelor I have decided to continue my study in Tunghai University as a Global MBA student. 

**Short Story of My Journey in Taiwan** 

I went to Taiwan with zero skill in Mandarin and went to a college majoring in Finance with full Mandarin Langauage Courses. I had really a hard time at the moment but I am truly beyond blessed and grateful for that. I often think back about my first year in Taiwan and how it shaped me in so many ways and had shaped me become the person that i am now. 

I can't believe I've already 5 years here in Taiwan. I am looking forward to have a working experience here after I graduated.
